      The two learning activities were adequate in engaging children in creative exploration according to age. The organization of the art activity in Video 1 promoted fine motor and imagination in the 3 to 5-year-old group. The child was attentive and this is an indication that materials and instructions are fine. The video about the sensory play with the 0–2 age group in Video 2 was an effective exploration of curiosity. The child played freely with the items, which showed that it was a secure as well as challenging environment.
    </p>
    <p class="card-text">
      A major advantage of the two enactments was enabling open-ended play that enabled children to learn per their pace. Also, the classroom conditions were peaceful and developmentally recommended. Nevertheless, one can still do something better. Video 1: additional materials (e.g., textured paper, stamps) would make creativity go even further. In Video 2, it could be better to add speaking or music to attract more senses and encourage early language development.
    </p>
    <p class="card-text">
      In the event that I recur such activities, however, I would be more emphatic on child-led decision-making such as letting the child choose the material(s) or pursue a variety of options. This would even liberate creativity and autonomy. Another behavior I would record might be the responses of children to recollect the developmental signals and adjust the experiences.

      In the mural-making activity with the 6–8-year-olds, a key strength was the high level of engagement and collaboration. The children actively contributed ideas, such as adding a school, sun, clouds, and other familiar places, demonstrating creativity while building a shared vision of their community. Another positive aspect was the encouragement of storytelling, which helped them connect personal experiences to the mural.
    </p>
    <p class="card-text">
      However, one area for improvement would be to create more opportunities for each child to explain their choices, as some shared ideas briefly without deeper discussion or reflection. Providing more time for individual storytelling could enhance their sense of ownership and communication skills.
    </p>
    <p class="card-text">
      In the sock puppet activity with the 1-year-old, the playful tone and repetition of “peekaboo” successfully captured the child’s attention and supported emerging language development. Maintaining consistent eye contact fostered joyful social connection. Nonetheless, extending the interaction with varied sounds, puppet movements, or naming additional facial features could have further enriched the sensory and linguistic experience.
    </p>
    <p class="card-text">
      If I were to repeat these activities, I would include more open-ended questions in the mural session to deepen storytelling, and expand vocabulary during the puppet play to enhance language learning, fostering richer creative and communicative experiences for the children.
